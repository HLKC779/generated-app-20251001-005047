## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
- `wrangler` CLI, which can be installed with `bun install -g wrangler`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibecode.git
    cd vibecode
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project and add your Cloudflare and AI provider credentials. You can use the `wrangler.jsonc` file as a reference.

    ```ini
    # .dev.vars

    # Cloudflare AI Gateway Credentials
    CF_AI_BASE_URL="https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_GATEWAY_ID/openai"
    CF_AI_API_KEY="YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY"

    # Optional: For web search tool
    SERPAPI_KEY="YOUR_SERPAPI_KEY"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts the Vite frontend and the `wrangler` dev server for the backend worker.
    ```sh
    bun run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîß Usage

Once the application is running, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

- **Dashboard**: View and manage your projects.
- **IDE**: The core coding environment with a file tree, editor, AI chat, and preview panel.
- **Templates**: Browse and start new projects from pre-built templates.
- **AI Chat**: Use the integrated AI assistant to generate code, ask questions, and get help.

## üíª Development

This project is a monorepo-style setup with the frontend and backend codebases in separate directories.

### Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the React frontend application code.
-   `worker/`: Contains the Hono backend application running on Cloudflare Workers.
-   `wrangler.jsonc`: Configuration file for the Cloudflare Worker.

### Available Scripts

-   `bun run dev`: Starts the development server for both frontend and backend.
-   `bun run build`: Builds the frontend application for production.
-   `bun run lint`: Lints the codebase.
-   `bun run deploy`: Deploys the application to Cloudflare.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed on the Cloudflare network.

1.  **Authenticate with Cloudflare:**
    ```sh
    bunx wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Deploy the application:**
    Run the deploy script from the root of the project. This will build the frontend and deploy the worker.
    ```sh
    bun run deploy
    ```

Wrangler will handle the deployment process and provide you with the URL of your deployed application.

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository using the button below.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The platform is a serverless application running entirely on Cloudflare. The frontend is a React SPA served via Cloudflare Pages. The backend is a set of Cloudflare Workers running a Hono API. Stateful logic for real-time collaboration and sandbox sessions is delegated to Durable Objects. The AI Gateway acts as a proxy and caching layer to multiple downstream AI providers. Data is stored across Cloudflare's ecosystem: D1 for relational metadata, R2 for large assets, and KV for caching.
